1/ ng add @angular/pwa
2/ ng build
builds the files and puts them in dist/<project-name>
in the project-name folder is the ngsw.json file
that is needed
3/ npm install http-server
4/ http-server -p 8080 -c-1 dist/<project-name>
or
cd /dist/<project-name>
http-server -p 8080 -c-1 .
-serve this directory "."
-disable cache "-c-1"  -c is cache, and the number
after it is how long so -c10 would be max,-c-1 is min or disabled

6/ you can go offline
  -from the network
    +after the "disable cache", arrow down, offline
  -from application
    +service-worker (above storage)
      select "offline"
7/ turn off wiifii /reload page - it's still there.
this shows that the service worker is working
8/ in the network tab in the "size" column, it shows "ServiceWorker"
9/ in the ngsw-config.json file, I added a prefetch to the
rose image so that if you go offline you can see that image .
if you remove it from the file, you wont see it.
