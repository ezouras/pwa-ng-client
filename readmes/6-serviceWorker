include the initial

of application bundles that get loaded
on the page.  These bundles are lost
after the user closes the page. if you
go offline and reload, there will be no
page.  HOwever, what the service worker

The service worker is installed via
a request from your webpage. You

on your client. When you register a service
worker for your site, it is installed on the browser.
