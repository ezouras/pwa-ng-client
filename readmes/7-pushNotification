Server side:
1/ we want to send a message to
all the subscribers

2/we trigger a push message.

3/ this message is received by the browser.
How does the server knjow which browser?
the subscription endpoint.

4/ How does the server know the subscription endpoint?
When you created a "subscription" object, when you
asked the user if they wanted to subscribe,
you must send the subscription object to the server.
the server
keeps it somewhere. It goes thru it's subscriber
objects and sends a push notification to those
endpoints.

5/ the browser receives the push notification.
The browser figures out which service worker
the push is for.  It does this via the subscription
properties. probably the "key" ? that is associated
with that subscription?

6/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API
The "Push_API"
from SERVER to Browser (not your web app)

7/ the NotificationsApi is what allows the message to
be displayed by the browser
from Browser to a popup notification for the user.
